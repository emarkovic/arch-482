Review from Jan 5
- browser requests file and file is delivered to the browser, this is stateless
- tim berners lee - first person that set out http and html, it was very simple at first
- wwwc = w3c - this is the collaborative governing body for the web

- linux and windows file paths are case sensitive 
- mac file paths are case insensitive

html
- <img src="">
- whitespace within the tags are not ignored 
	ex. "<   b  >" will be displayed as "< b >"
