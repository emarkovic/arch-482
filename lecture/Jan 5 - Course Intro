Servers vs Clients
	servers -> wifi/ethernet -> client
	when a machine connects to a network, the network assigns that machine a unique IP address
	there are domains on top of ip addresses which allows us humans to easily access those files 

Protocol
- ftp - file transfer protocol, this one was bad because it passed passwords in plain text
- "sftp" or "ftp over ssh" was a more secure protocol.
	


Sir Tim Berners Lee - Father of the Web
- needed a way to exchange files with other scientists, the best way to do this would be on a network
- CERN
- HTTP - hypertext transfer protocol
	- sets the standard for file transfer
- how to make sure that files across machines and servers look the same?
	- wysiwyg - what you see is what you get - like microsoft world, but html is not like this
	- markup - more symbols are added that make text or whatever appear the way you really want it to.
		html = hypertext markup language, browser standard for text

Browsers
- 1st is mosiac, then netscape, then, in time, microsoft internet explorer
- broswers were open source so anyone can contribute and make their own browsers
	- people got crazy with their additions - this is where <blink></blink> came from.		
- how to distinguish btwn different kinds of content
	- text - html 
	- appearance - css
	- behavior - javascript
		- link 

IP addresses, Domains and file structures
- quicksilver.be.washington.edu -> 128.95.168.40
- its convenient to think of file structures as trees
				top
			  /     \
			a 		  b
		  /  \
		one   two	
		/
	file.ext		
	-> http://quicksilver.be.washington.edu/a/one/file.ext <- where the file is and how to get it
	   ^ url/uri	
	- the http tells it what format to fetch at
